        <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A little while ago I found the <a href="https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop">OWASP Juice Shop</a>, 
and thoroughly enjoyed stumbling my way through its various challenges. The Juice Shop page itself 
can explain what it's about better than I need to here, but anybody looking for a stepping stone 
into the strange and mystical world of security testing, or even just web application testing in 
general, would be well-advised to check it out.  </p>
<p>After sharing it with my team at work, I wrote a guide to help them progress through 
various challenges at their own pace, without feeling <em>too</em> lost. While writing that, 
I ended up including snippets of Python code I was running from the REPL to demonstrate, 
and thought "<em>...hey, I could probably automate this whole thing!</em>"  </p>
<p>This blog is the result, and the code for the impatient ones is 
<a href="https://github.com/incognitjoe/juice-shop-solver">here</a>. 
This blog and the linked repository were written against version 
<a href="https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/tag/v2.18.0">2.18</a>
of the Juice Shop - naturally, by the time I got around to writing this, there's been an update that 
added a new challenge which I haven't had a chance to really look at yet. Something to do after I finish 
writing this!  Anyway, below is the full list of challenges along with some (hopefully) useful 
explanations for how I figured them out initially.  </p>
<p><strong>SPOILER WARNING</strong>: everything below here should only be read if you've completed as much as 
you can of the Juice Shop.</p>
<h1>Preparation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Grab a copy of the Juice Shop from the link above. For the remainder of this blog I'll be assuming 
it lives at http://localhost:3000.  </li>
<li>Take a look at the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">OWASP Top Ten Project</a> 
for areas to consider.  </li>
<li>Some familiarity with your browser's development tools.  </li>
<li>Everybody has their own favourite exploratory testing tools, I find 
<a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/">BURP Suite</a> or the 
<a href="https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy">OWASP Zed Attack Proxy</a> useful to proxy my browser requests 
through so I can review the requests my testing ends up making. If you're not seeing requests 
to and from the Juice Shop, make sure you're not excluding requests to localhost accidentally:<br />
<img alt="Firefox proxy config" src="images/firefox_zap_proxy_config.png" />  </li>
<li>Create a user account in the Juice Shop(Login &gt; Register Now!). It doesn't <em>have</em> to be a 
real email address, but we'll want to log in as somebody to poke around initially, 
and we don't know how to hack in to anybody else's account <em>yet</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Right, let's do this!</p>
<h2>One-star challenges</h2>
<h3>Find the carefully hidden 'Score Board' page.</h3>
<p>Nice light start. Viewing the source of any page in the Juice Shop reveals a commented-out 
section of the header bar:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">&lt;!--</span>
<span class="c">&lt;li class=&quot;dropdown&quot;&gt;</span>
<span class="c">    &lt;a href=&quot;#/score-board&quot;&gt;Score Board&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="c">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="c">--&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So opening <code>http://localhost:3000/#/score-board</code> completes this challenge. The score board 
helpfully lists all the available flags, and at the end of the list, a Continue code that 
can be used to restore our progress. This updates with every new flag awarded - it's worth 
copying regularly, particularly if you're trying to inject data into the Juice Shop as you
may mistakenly crash the whole thing!</p>
<h3>Provoke an error that is not very gracefully handled.</h3>
<p>There's probably at least a dozen ways you can trip this flag, even without noticing. For now, 
let's try to login as <code>test'</code>(note the apostrophe) with any old password. It'll fail, showing 
us a SQLite error that'll come in handy later...</p>
<h3>XSS Tier 1: Perform a reflected XSS attack with <code>&lt;script&gt;alert("XSS1")&lt;/script&gt;</code>.</h3>
<p>OK, things are heating up. If you're unfamiliar with Cross-site scripting(XSS) attacks, 
they're used by attackers to execute code in a victim's browser. A <em>reflected</em> XSS attack means 
the malicious payload is coming from the victim's request, somehow. If we copy the payload 
and paste it into the Search bar of the Juice Shop, we'll get a nasty little pop-up and a 
lovely little challenge complete notification, but what actually happened?  </p>
<p>Well, once you've closed the XSS alert, take a look at the URL in your browser. Notice how 
we're at <code>http://localhost:3000/#/search?q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS1%22)%3C%2Fscript%3E</code>? 
The search bar provides the malicious payload as our search parameter, then the <em>Search Results</em> 
panel tries to display this without any sanitization, causing our script to fire. If we 
inspect the search results panel with the browser dev tools, we can see it pretty clearly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">span</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;label label-default ng-binding&quot;</span> <span class="na">ng-bind-html</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;searchQuery&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;XSS1&quot;</span><span class="p">)&lt;/</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">span</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This means, if the Juice Shop were a live site, some evildoer could send some innocent soul 
a link to the search page, with the payload set to some kind of nasty script, and it'll 
execute in their browser.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, since this requires a Javascript engine to fire for the challenge award, it's one 
of the two challenges that use Selenium in my scripted solutions.  </p>
<h3>Get rid of all 5-star customer feedback.</h3>
<p>There's a number of ways you can achieve this, but the first method I stumbled on was 
deleting it directly from the administration panel(accessing this is a later challenge...). 
As it turns out, <em>any</em> logged in user can accomplish this - a lesson in making sure your 
admin functions are actually limited to admin users!</p>
<h3>Access a confidential document.</h3>
<p>Clicking around the site some more, we end up in the 'About Us' section, which is a huge block 
of placeholder text except for one link - 
"Check out our boring terms of use if you are interested in such lame stuff."<br />
Following this link opens a legal.md file, which is indeed boring, but where it <em>is</em> 
interests us: <code>http://localhost:3000/ftp/legal.md?md_debug=true</code>. So far, 
we haven't seen any links to that ftp directory. If we open <code>http://localhost:3000/ftp</code> 
directly, we get a list of other files, one of which is <code>acquisitions.md</code> - grab that to 
solve this challenge. Some of the other files in this directory are protected, but don't 
worry, we'll be back.  </p>
<h3>Access the administration section of the store.</h3>
<p>I randomly guessed this was located at <code>http://localhost:3000/#/administration</code>. We could 
have used something like the Forced Browse ZAP extension(a plugin based on 
<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_DirBuster_Project">DirBuster</a>) to reveal it
though.</p>
<h3>Give a devastating zero-star feedback to the store.</h3>
<p>We can provide feedback through the Contact Us section of the store. It automatically 
populates our email address(or sets it to anonymous if we're not logged in), but requires 
a comment and a rating before we can submit. However, this check is flawed - by entering a 
comment, selecting a single star, then <em>selecting that same star again to remove the rating</em>, 
we're able to submit a zero-star feedback and claim this challenge.</p>
<h2>Two-star challenges</h2>
<h3>Log in with the administrator's user account.</h3>
<p>Remember that SQLite error we encountered earlier? Let's take a closer look 
at it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;error&quot;</span><span class="p">:{</span>
<span class="nt">&quot;message&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;SQLITE_ERROR: unrecognized token: \&quot;0cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661\&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="nt">&quot;stack&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;Error: SQLITE_ERROR: unrecognized token: \&quot;0cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661\&quot;\n at Error (native)&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="nt">&quot;errno&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="nt">&quot;code&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;SQLITE_ERROR&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="nt">&quot;sql&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = &#39;test&#39;&#39; AND password = &#39;0cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661&#39;&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Quite a bit to digest, but that 'sql' bit is interesting:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Users</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;test&#39;&#39; AND password = &#39;</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="n">cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661</span><span class="err">&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It's the full query that tries to execute when we login, but apparently it doesn't like our 
apostrophe. So, breaking out the SQL injection bag of tricks(or running a tool like SQLmap),
we can try manipulating the query by logging in as <code>' OR 1=1--</code> with any old password. 
The apostrophe closes the <code>WHERE email =</code> condition early, at which point we inject an 
OR to check if the number one is equal to the number one.  </p>
<p>It is, shockingly, and the rest of the query becomes a comment 
thanks to the double dashes, so now the query executed should read 
<code>SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE EMAIL = '' OR 1=1--</code>... and we're logged in as the administrator.
It seems like the site accepted the first result from that SELECT * FROM USERS, 
and user ID #1 just happens to be the admin. Fantastic.</p>
<h3>Log in with the administrator's user credentials without previously changing them or applying SQL Injection.</h3>
<p>Let's head back to the administration panel. We can see a list of usernames, but no 
passwords, unfortunately - however, that's not entirely true. If we check out the Network 
tab in our browser's dev console while opening this page, we can see a call made to 
<code>http://localhost:3000/rest/user/authentication-details/</code>. Checking the response body for 
this, we can see a list of all user objects, including some sensitive stuff that isn't
displayed by the user interface:
<code>[...]{"id":1,"email":"admin@juice-sh.op","password":"0192023a7bbd73250516f069df18b500"[...]</code><br />
That's not the plaintext password, it's the hash stored in the database. Unfortunately, it's
a very weak password, and Googling it reveals it's been cracked long ago. Logging in with
<code>admin@juice-sh.op</code> with password <code>admin123</code> awards this challenge.</p>
<h3>Access someone else's basket.</h3>
<p>Still logged in as admin, let's open our dev tools to the Network tab, then click on 
'My Basket'. We can see a call to '1', the full path of which is 
<code>http://localhost:3000/rest/basket/1</code>. Trying to open this URL without being logged in 
returns a 401 Unauthorized response, but we can use Firefox's handy 'Edit and resend' 
functionality by right-clicking this request and selecting it. Changing the 
target url to <code>http://localhost:3000/rest/basket/2</code>, keeping our existing auth headers and 
so on, completes this challenge.
<img alt="" src="images/firefox_edit_and_resend.png" /></p>
<h3>Access a salesman's forgotten backup file.</h3>
<p>Let's hop back into the /ftp folder. <code>coupons_2013.md.bak</code> certainly sounds like the kind 
of thing somebody in Sales would be interested in, but trying to access it throws an error - 
only .md and .pdf files are allowed. When we first encountered this directory, the 
<code>legal.md</code> file also had a parameter provided - <code>?md_debug=true</code>. Adding this to the file 
doesn't help much, but by changing 'true' to '.md', and accessing 
<code>http://localhost:3000/ftp/coupons_2013.md.bak?md_debug=.md</code> we're able to open this file 
and complete the challenge. The contents are a list of coupons... that'll come in handy later.</p>
<h3>Inform the shop about an algorithm or library it should definitely not use the way it does.</h3>
<p>This challenge requires us to grab the <em>developer's</em> backup file in /ftp, which we haven't 
solved yet. In the interest of ticking off challenges as we go, let's just submit a comment 
saying "z85 0.0", and we can explain it later.</p>
<h3>Order the Christmas special offer of 2014.</h3>
<p>Nothing in the available products for Christmas 2014... bah humbug. We already know the 
login form is vulnerable to SQLi attacks though, so let's take a look at whether or not 
the products search has similar problems. Pop open the dev console and try searching for 
<code>test'</code>(again, note the apostrophe). 500 Server Error, and the response body is another
SQL error. Let's look at the query:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Products</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="k">LIKE</span> <span class="s1">&#39;%test&#39;</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="s1">&#39; OR description LIKE &#39;</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="n">test</span><span class="s1">&#39;%&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">deletedAt</span> <span class="k">IS</span> <span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">name</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Right at the end, we can see <code>deletedAt IS NULL</code> - the database must perform some kind of 
soft delete. If we can truncate the query before it reaches that filter, maybe we can find 
our special. Looking at the first occurence of our test string, we see it's in the middle of
a wildcard search. Let's try searching for <code>christmas%25'))--</code> - the %25 is a url-encoded 
percentage sign, the apostrophe breaks the query, the double brackets close the opening 
brackets after WHERE cleanly, and the double dash comments out the rest of the line. 
Popping that string into the search bar returns only "Christmas Super-Surprise-Box 
(2014 Edition)" - sounds like our jam. Let's pop that in our basket and checkout to 
complete this challenge.</p>
<h2>Three-star challenges</h2>
<h3>Log in with Jim's user account.</h3>
<p>From the same method we used to retrieve the administrator's password earlier, we can 
retrieve Jim's, and his password is also weak enough to be available through a quick search.</p>
<h3>Log in with Bender's user account.</h3>
<p>Bender, however, is clever and apparently chose a strong password. We've already broken the
login form to bypass the need for passwords entirely, though, so let's just change our 
injection string from <code>' OR 1=1--</code> to <code>bender@juice-sh.op'--</code> - this changes the query to 
<code>SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE email='bender@juice-sh.op'</code>, and accepts whatever password we 
provide since it's unchecked. </p>
<h3>XSS Tier 2: Perform a persisted XSS attack with <code>&lt;script&gt;alert("XSS2")&lt;/script&gt;</code> bypassing a client-side security mechanism.</h3>
<p>We've already seen a reflected XSS - a <em>persisted</em> XSS means it's coming from somewhere 
within the site itself, typically injected into a database. This means we no longer need to 
target and trick a specific person to follow a URL we crafted, but instead can catch any 
of the site users who happen across our payload. This challenge is asking about <em>client-side</em> 
security mechanisms, and we've seen one of those during our preparation - when creating 
a user account, the form demands a valid email address. Well, let's see about that. Log out, 
then head back to the registration window. Let's open our dev tools, and create a valid 
user "nobody@nobody.com" with a valid password. We can see in the Network panel that a
POST request was sent to /api/Users, with the following request body:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;password&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;abcde&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">&quot;passwordRepeat&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;abcde&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">&quot;email&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;nobody@nobody.com&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Edit and resend time! Let's change that email(note the escaped quotes):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;password&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;abcde&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">&quot;passwordRepeat&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;abcde&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">&quot;email&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;&lt;script&gt;alert(\&quot;XSS2\&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Challenge complete. Now anybody who views the administration panel, which displays user 
email addresses, gets hit by our XSS payload.</p>
<h3>XSS Tier 3: Perform a persisted XSS attack with <code>&lt;script&gt;alert("XSS3")&lt;/script&gt;</code> without using the frontend application at all.</h3>
<p>This time, we're looking for a way to persist data through a vector that the user interface
doesn't reveal. After much poking and prodding, you may have noticed that while we frequently 
perform GETs to /api/Products, we have no way of updating those items... or do we? Let's drop 
down to the command line and use cUrl to perform an OPTIONS request for a product, dumping
the headers to stdout:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ curl -X OPTIONS -D - <span class="s1">&#39;http://localhost:3000/api/Products/1&#39;</span>
HTTP/1.1 <span class="m">204</span> No Content
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE
Date: Mon, <span class="m">19</span> Dec <span class="m">2016</span> 04:24:33 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
</pre></div>


<p>That Access-Control-Allow-Methods is promising. Could be a configuration issue and they're 
not going to work, but we'll give it a shot anyway:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>curl -X PUT <span class="s2">&quot;http://localhost:3000/api/Products/1&quot;</span> -H <span class="s2">&quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;</span> --data-binary <span class="s1">&#39;{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&lt;script&gt;alert(\&quot;XSS3\&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;&quot;}&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>...and the response is...
<code>[...]"status":"success"[...]</code>
Challenge solved. Might want to change that back to something less annoying if you're still
exploring, otherwise you'll see it on every search page.</p>
<h3>Retrieve a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection</h3>
<p>More SQLi trickery. The easiest place to pull a list of data into would be the search 
page, from a cursory examination, but we have a problem - the query that page executes is 
only pulling from the Products table, and we want Users. SQLmap could help you here, but 
let's do this by hand for the exercise - we want a UNION SELECT command that will allow us 
to combine a search of the Users table with our Products search. Let's start with an injection 
that returns zero results for products(who wants 'em?), and tries to union the users table:
<code>invalid')) UNION SELECT * FROM USERS--</code>. With our dev console open, let's pop that in the 
search bar, and...500 Internal Server Error. The error message is new though: <br />
<code>SQLITE_ERROR: SELECTs to the left and right of UNION do not have the same number of result columns</code><br />
Aha! The query worked, we just need an equal number of columns from both tables. With a 
bit of trial and error, we eventually work out the number and order to get our injection 
returning all user emails, password hashes and IDs in our results page:<br />
<code>invalid')) UNION SELECT NULL,email,password,id,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM USERS--</code><br />
Challenge complete, user table dumped. 
<img alt="" src="images/juice_shop_sqli_user_list.png" /></p>
<h3>Post some feedback in another users name.</h3>
<p>We've already given a zero-star feedback, but let's take a look at that request payload 
a bit more carefully:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;UserId&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">&quot;comment&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;hi hello&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">&quot;rating&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Edit and resend to the rescue again. Editing our payload to a different(valid) UserId solves 
this challenge.</p>
<h3>Place an order that makes you rich.</h3>
<p>Like a lot of people, I only really care about money when I don't have any. Let's see if 
we can figure out how to get the Juice Shop paying us back for our not-good deads. Browsing 
over to the products search with our dev tools open and adding an item to our empty 
basket(important note: adding a new item behaves differently than adding an existing item!), 
we can see a POST request to <code>http://localhost:3000/api/BasketItems/1</code>, where 1 is our user id. 
The request payload for that looks like this:<br />
<code>{"ProductId":1,"BasketId":"1","quantity":1}</code><br />
...where ProductId is the product we want, BasketId is the same as our user id, and quantity
is naturally the amount we want. Let's try a simple boundary check here and order a negative 
number - let's edit and resend that request, but with a different ProductId and quantity:<br />
<code>{"ProductId":17,"BasketId":"1","quantity":-999}</code><br />
Browsing to our basket reveals that the Juice Shop has accepted our order, and checking out 
grants us all the imaginary money we need for now.</p>
<h3>Access a developer's forgotten backup file.</h3>
<p>Back to /ftp we go. We can see a <code>package.json.bak</code> in here, but our earlier trick with 
the md_debug flag isn't working. Luckily we have other tricks up our sleeves, such as 
<a href="http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246949/Null%20Byte%20Injection">Null byte injection</a>.
Appending %2500.md(%25 is a URL encoded percentage sign, so we're asking for %00.md) might get 
us past the filter, only to hopefully vanish at the filesystem layer and retrieve the actual 
file instead. Opening <code>localhost:3000/ftp/package.json.bak%2500.md</code> in our browser does 
indeed allow us to download this file, solving this challenge and giving us a lot more 
information on how the site was built.</p>
<h3>Change the href of the link within the O-Saft product description into http://kimminich.de.</h3>
<p>The same cUrl trick we used to overwrite a product description for XSS3 will work here, 
just target the O-Saft product ID and PUT the updated description instead.</p>
<h3>Inform the shop about a vulnerable library it is using. (Mention the exact library name and version in your comment.)</h3>
<p>There's a couple of options here now that we have the developer's package.json to peruse, 
but considering the havoc we've been wreaking with SQLi, it seems only fair to submit 
"sequelize 1.7" as our vulnerable library.</p>
<h3>Find the hidden easter egg.</h3>
<p>/ftp folder again, this time grab the eastere.gg file using a null byte injection, same as 
the developer backup.</p>
<h3>Travel back in time to the golden era of web design.</h3>
<p>This Web 2.0 gimmick has grown a bit stale, and it's time to return to browsing in style. 
If we check out the source of the HOT picture in this challenge description, we can see it's 
serving up from somewhere interesting...<code>http://localhost:3000/css/geo-bootstrap/img/hot.gif</code>. 
Googling 'geo-bootstrap' reveals that it is most certainly <em>not</em> the theme currently in play, 
but the Juice Shop seems to have it installed anyway. Let's go ahead and open the dev console,
hop to the Console tab, and after a bit of guesswork set the current theme to geo-bootstrap 
instead with the following command:<br />
<code>$('#theme').attr('href', '/css/geo-bootstrap/swatch/bootstrap.css')</code><br />
Awesome. Challenge complete, but the satisfaction pales in comparison to our fancy new theme. </p>
<h3>Upload a file larger than 100 kB.</h3>
<p>The filesize(and filename, next challenge) filtering both seem to happen in the user interface. 
Since I do most of my file transfer stuff in Python, let's just use a Python 
script(Requests library) and be done with it instead of messing around with form boundaries 
and such:</p>

<p>This solves the next challenge also.</p>
<h3>Upload a file that has no .pdf extension.</h3>
<p>See previous solution.</p>
<h3>Log in with Bjoern's user account without previously changing his password, applying SQL Injection, or hacking his Google account.</h3>
<p>OK, so we saw in the database dump that Bjoern has a googlemail account. Maybe he used that 
Google OAuth option on the login window? Let's give it a whirl with our own account and see 
what happens. OK, sent to Google, asked to log in, then prompted for permission for the 
OWASP Juice Shop. Allow, back to the juice shop, and... there's a POST to /api/Users:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;email&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;incognitjoeb@gmail.com&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">&quot;password&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;aW5jb2duaXRqb2ViQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Hmm. We didn't set any password. Maybe it's grabbing... something from the OAuth mechanism.
The next request made was to /login, with this payload:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;email&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;incognitjoeb@gmail.com&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">&quot;password&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;aW5jb2duaXRqb2ViQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">&quot;oauth&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Same password. Let's log out and do that again. This time, the POST to /api/Users 
tried to send <em>the same email and password</em>, but it hit a snag:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;status&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;error&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">&quot;message&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;errno&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">&quot;code&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;SQLITE_CONSTRAINT&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="nt">&quot;sql&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;INSERT INTO `Users` (`id`,`email`,`password`,`createdAt`,`updatedAt`) VALUES (NULL,&#39;incognitjoeb@gmail.com&#39;,&#39;71e04ae51b15603eb1e106ea7cb92b30&#39;,&#39;2016-12-19 05:36:33.000 +00:00&#39;,&#39;2016-12-19 05:36:33.000 +00:00&#39;);&quot;</span><span class="p">}}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The call to /login afterwards worked, though. So if an OAuth user doesn't exist yet, the 
juice shop will automagically make their account and set a password, which is static despite 
repeated OAuth logins returning new tokens. If it's static it might be something we can 
figure out...and luckily the password ending in == gives us a clue that it's base64-encoded. 
Let's decode that and see where we're at(use an online tool if you want):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">base64</span>
<span class="n">base64</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">b64decode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;aW5jb2duaXRqb2ViQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Which prints out..."incognitjoeb@gmail.com"? Oh, that's not good, the account creation process 
is setting default passwords as the base64-encoded email address. Yep, you guessed it, base64-encode
Bjoern's email address to find his password, no OAuth wizardry required.</p>
<h2>Four-star challenges</h2>
<h3>XSS Tier 4: Perform a persisted XSS attack with <code>&lt;script&gt;alert("XSS4")&lt;/script&gt;</code> bypassing a server-side security mechanism.</h3>
<p>We've been shoving unsanitized input here, there and everywhere it seems, but there is one entrypoint 
that is actually doing <em>something</em> - if we try to send feedback with a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in the comment, 
the response indicates it was stripped out entirely(along with its contents) in the response. 
So, sending this challenge's payload as a comment just comes back with an empty comment. Super. 
Let's take a look through the package.json.bak and see what could be doing that...<code>sanitize-html</code> 
certainly seems like a candidate. v1.4.2 is installed, which is apparently 
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html">a bit out of date</a> since the latest is 1.13.0 at 
the time of writing. Looking through the changelog, we can see an interesting entry for 1.4.3:<br />
<code>1.4.3: invokes itself recursively until the markup stops changing to guard against this issue. Bump to htmlparser2 version 3.7.x.</code><br />
Interesting, the version in use has an unpatched bug, and that entry links us to an 
<a href="https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2/issues/105">example</a> of how to exploit. Let's go ahead
and try putting some bait tags in the middle of our payload tags, so they'll be removed and 
hopefully our reign of terror can continue. Entering <code>&lt;&lt;/b&gt;script&gt;alert("XSS4")&lt;&lt;/b&gt;/script&gt;</code>
as a feedback comment and submitting wins us this challenge.</p>
<h3>Wherever you go, there you are.</h3>
<p>It took me forever to even work out what this meant. Eventually I ended up hovering over the 
'Fork me on Github!' banner, and noticed it's pointing to a redirect page instead of linking 
direct: <code>http://localhost:3000/redirect?to=https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop</code>. 
Replacing the 'to=' param with a site of our choosing returns an error: 406 Unrecognized 
Target URL. OK, now we know what we have to beat. Since there's obviously something checking 
the parameters in this request for a whitelisted URL, let's see if it's smart enough to 
tell the difference between a parameter for <code>?to</code> or if it's just taking the final parameter 
and assuming that's the target, by opening:<br />
<code>http://localhost:3000/redirect?to=https://google.ie/?https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop</code><br />
Guess not. Wherever you go, it should be the next challenge because we're done here.</p>
<h3>Change Bender's password into slurmCl4ssic without using SQL Injection.</h3>
<p>Goodbye SQLi, you were a good friend but we must part ways for now. Let's go take a look at 
this 'Change Password' window. Current password, new password and repeat new password. Not 
so good - we can log in as Bender with a SQLi(welcome back old friend!), but we don't know his
current password so this window won't help us much. Let's put in some random text for the 
current password and just see where the call goes anyway...and we see a GET(?!) appear:<br />
<code>http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?current=abcde&amp;new=slurmCl4ssic&amp;repeat=slurmCl4ssic</code><br />
This returns a 401 unauthorized, with the message 'Current password is not correct', but we 
were kind of expecting that. Let's put this endpoint through its paces, and drop the 
<code>current=abcde</code> bit altogether to see what happens...oops. Looks like it worked, if the 
<em>current</em> parameter is excluded then the new and repeat are instantly accepted, 
putting all users at risk of a 
<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)">CSRF</a> attack 
that could change their passwords.  </p>
<p><strong>Bonus round</strong>: let's go ahead and prove 
this out by using one of our XSS exploits to trigger a password change. Log in as any user 
you want, then open 
<a href="http://localhost:3000/#/search?q=%3Cscript%3Exmlhttp%20%3D%20new%20XMLHttpRequest;%20xmlhttp.open('GET',%20'http:%2F%2Flocalhost:3000%2Frest%2Fuser%2Fchange-password%3Fnew%3DslurmCl4ssic%26repeat%3DslurmCl4ssic');%20xmlhttp.send()%3C%2Fscript%3E">this</a> 
link:<br />
<code>http://localhost:3000/#/search?q=%3Cscript%3Exmlhttp%20%3D%20new%20XMLHttpRequest;%20xmlhttp.open('GET',%20'http:%2F%2Flocalhost:3000%2Frest%2Fuser%2Fchange-password%3Fnew%3DslurmCl4ssic%26repeat%3DslurmCl4ssic');%20xmlhttp.send()%3C%2Fscript%3E</code><br />
Not the easiest to remember, but oh well, this is why URL shorteners were invented. Look 
at your network traffic in the dev console - see that call to change-password? Congratulations, 
now your password is slurmCl4ssic too. Log out and back in to confirm. Let's clean up that
URL-encoded payload a bit and see what we're looking at:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="nx">xmlhttp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">XMLHttpRequest</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nx">xmlhttp</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">send</span><span class="p">()</span>

</pre></div>


<p>Nasty - by following a search link sent by some villain, they've changed our password. Since 
we <em>don't</em> get logged out by this activity, we might not even notice - this extremely crude 
payload returns a blank search panel since it breaks the SQL search, which is pretty much the
only clue a normal user would have that something was amiss.  </p>
<p>I really, really like this challenge.</p>
<h3>Apply some advanced cryptanalysis to find the real easter egg.</h3>
<p>Read the eastere.gg file and play this one out for yourself - don't be afraid, it's not 
as daunting as you might think. There's two rounds of encoding at play, is all I'll say here - 
you can check the 
<a href="https://github.com/incognitjoe/juice-shop-solver">automated repository</a> 
for the solution if you really want, it's in the misc.py file. </p>
<h3>Retrieve the language file that never made it into production.</h3>
<p>Watching the network traffic whenever we load a page gives us the location of the language 
files - <code>http://localhost:3000/i18n/en.json</code> gives us all the strings in the juice shop in 
English, for example. See the 
<a href="https://github.com/incognitjoe/juice-shop-solver">automated repo</a>
for the source file I used to bruteforce my way through this challenge - there's
a lot more language codes than I knew about!</p>
<h3>Exploit OAuth 2.0 to log in with the Chief Information Security Officer's user account.</h3>
<p>OK, we figured out how to find the default passwords for users <em>who signed up with OAuth</em>, 
but this is clearly a different kind of problem - it's an internal(@juice-sh.op) address, 
it's the CISO so we'd hope for some level of password security, and so on. Plus the challenge 
is directly telling us we have to exploit OAuth 2.0 somehow. This should be interesting...  </p>
<p>...in fact, I solved this one accidentally, and it took me at least fifteen minutes to even 
figure out what had happened. So, let's start from the basics here - the login window. We've 
got an email field, a password field, a Log In button, a Google OAuth login button, and a 
link to "Register Now!". Oh, and a Remember Me checkbox, like every other login window... 
actually, let's see what that does. First let's log in with credentials we actually have. 
Now, take a look at your cookies, since that's how Remember Me functionality usually works...
and yep, we have a cookie from the juice shop with an email key and our user's email address 
as the value. Browse around the site a bit, and pay attention to your headers - see that 
<code>X-User-Email</code> header? We didn't seem to have that before. Must be coming from our cookie! 
Let's log out and try to log in as <code>ciso@juice-sh.op</code> with an invalid password but 
Remember Me ticked. Doing this sets our cookie email value to the CISO, so our user email 
header is the CISO too, but that doesn't get us much further... until we remember this is 
an OAuth challenge, and log in using the OAuth mechanism... and boom, we're done!  </p>
<p>The solution in the 
<a href="https://github.com/incognitjoe/juice-shop-solver">automated repository</a>
might be cleaner to read, but the flaw here seems to be that the OAuth integration
for login will accept the 'X-User-Email' header as gospel <em>regardless of the account 
that just logged in</em>, so this header combined with a 'valid' OAuth login(you 
can actually just set it to true in the payload sent to /login !) exposes the CISO's account.</p>
<h2>Five-star challenges</h2>
<h3>Forge a coupon code that gives you a discount of at least 80%.</h3>
<p>Let's dig out that coupons backup file we recovered so long ago. Looking at the last 
characters at each of the coupons, there seems to be some commonality, but it's impossible 
to say what...except we already said it, way back in the "Inform the shop about an algorithm
or library it should definitely not use the way it does." - 
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/z85">z85</a> is being used for encoding these coupons. From 
the spec:<br />
<code>The binary frame SHALL have a length that is divisible by 4 with no remainder. The string frame SHALL have a length that is divisible by 5 with no remainder.</code>
Our coupons are all 10 characters long. Trying to enter any other length in the checkout window
actually tells us they <em>must</em> be 10 characters precisely. So we're looking at two string frames
per coupon, and by decoding them, we can probably figure out the pattern:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">zmq.utils</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">z85</span>

<span class="c1"># Output: &#39;OCT13-10&#39;</span>

<span class="c1"># Output: &#39;SEP13-10&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There we go - three characters for the month, two digits for the year, a dash and then the 
desired percentage off. It's Christmas time, so let's give ourselves a nice 99% off by 
z85 encoding 'DEC16-99', applying that coupon and checking out!</p>
<h3>Fake a continue code that solves only (the non-existent) challenge #99.</h3>
<p>Not going to walk through this one either, but I will give some pointers:  </p>
<ul>
<li>grab your continue code <em>now</em> , restart the juice shop, then apply your continue code while 
dev console is open and watch what happens  </li>
<li>since your continue code obviously has more than one challenge completed, whatever's 
generating the codes must be able to take a range of IDs as input  </li>
<li>whenever you're researching a new package, it's always worth going through the demos on 
the authors site and paying close attention  </li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this is also solved in the 
<a href="https://github.com/incognitjoe/juice-shop-solver">automated repo</a> 
if you really want to spoil yourself, I won't judge. Well, yes I will, but I'll do it quietly.</p>
